Feel free to fork this project, it's under
the MIT license, as are all related files
here. If you'd like to see your changes on the main project, send a pull request! I (publisher) do ask that you keep and add notes, as there is an extreme amount of code here with lots of dependencies elsewhere in said code, notes make it much easier to interpret for someone illiterate in or newer to Python.
